/*
    This file is for Cover Letter specific CSS.
    Most general styling (forms, buttons, page layout) is now handled by
    Tailwind CSS utility classes in the HTML templates and app_base.html.

    Styles for the visual appearance of the generated cover letter itself
    (the "document" look) are primarily handled by an inline <style> block
    within frontend/templates/cover_letter_template.html, especially classes
    like .letter-content-preview and @media print rules.

    This file can be used for any highly specific overrides or additional
    styles for the cover letter module that are not covered elsewhere.
    For now, it is kept minimal as most styling has been migrated to
    Tailwind utilities or inline in the specific template.
